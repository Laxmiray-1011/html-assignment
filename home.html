        <h2><em>Incredible India!</em></h2>
        <h3><u><i>About the India</i></u></h3>
        <p>One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of
            multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad
            attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist
            destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km,
            extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical
            rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world,
            India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by
            mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct
            geographical entity.

            Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards
            and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean
            between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the
            west. As you travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by
            diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature,
            lands, tribes, history and adventure sports.</p>
